## Installing Charts

You can install these Helm Charts by running: 
```
helm install --name <YOUR HELM RELEASE NAME> zeeeb/zeebe-full
```
This command will install all Zeebe Components that are provided by the `zeebe-full` chart. 


## Uninstalling Charts

You can remove these charts by running:
```
helm delete <YOUR HELM RELEASE NAME> --no-hooks --purge
```

> Notice that all the servives and pods will be deleted, but not the Persitence Volume Claims which are used to hold the storage for the data generated by the cluster and ElasticSearch. In order to free up the storage you need to manually delete all the Persistent Volume Claims. You can do this by running: 
```
kubectl get pvc
```
Then delete the ones that you don't want to keep:
```
kubectl delete pvc <PVC ids here>
```
